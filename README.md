## About Me  
Iâ€™m an aspiring **Backend or Full-Stack Software Developer** who enjoys building systems that are practical, reliable, and easy to use. I like working on projects where the code directly helps people â€” whether thatâ€™s making tools faster, simplifying how information is shared, or creating features that feel seamless. Iâ€™m also interested in using technology to bring people together and support solutions that make a positive impact in everyday life.

## What I Do  

**Software & Systems Development**

I primarily work with **Java** and **Python** to build reliable back-end systems and machine learning applications. My projects have included recommendation features, financial simulations, and classification systems, where I focus on writing clean, scalable code that supports real-world use.

**Machine Learning Applications**

Using tools like **TensorFlow**, **scikit-learn**, and modern **LLM APIs**, Iâ€™ve developed models for recommendations, natural language tasks, and computer vision. I enjoy taking these models beyond the research stage â€” integrating them into practical applications that people can actually use.

**Full-Stack Development**

I leverage React, Node.js, and MongoDB to build end-to-end web applications with user-friendly interfaces. My experience also extends to **Spring Boot**, **SQL**, and containerization tools like **Docker**, which I use to deliver solutions for both community-driven platforms and enterprise-level tools.
